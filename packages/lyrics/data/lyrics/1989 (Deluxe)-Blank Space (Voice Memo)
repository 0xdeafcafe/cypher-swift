So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we wanna go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying
Um, so I brought in this idea called "Blank Space," and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these proju— production ideas like, you know the "Oh!" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song
So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called "Blank Space."

"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds, seasides, all these gems
 this song that Like, oh my God, listen in
Listen in, I do too
 honest We can all sing this and cry
All you're thinking, all this time
Oh my God, listen me
Just forget what you've heard about me
Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me
'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go—
Yeah! Hey, hey!
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over—
This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track
Long list of ex-love—
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
I'll write your name
I've got a blank space, baby
I'll write your name"
That's awesome! I love it
Oh my god, everyone's gonna kill you
Yeah!
