Flashing lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better (Eh, eh)

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland

So, we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin'
And whispers turned to talkin'
And talking turned to screams, oh

Didn't they tell us "Don't rush into things"?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?
Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darling

We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) Eh, eh
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
In Wonderland
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh) Woah
In Wonderland

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin' else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad
Oh

We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Last forever; Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (Never better; Eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Lost in it)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh)
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland
