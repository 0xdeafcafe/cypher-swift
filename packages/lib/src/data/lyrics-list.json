	"But it's comin' down",
	"No sound, it's all around",
	"Like snow on the beach",
	"Like snow, ah",
	"This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen",
	"I searched \"aurora borealis green\"",
	"I've never seen someone lit from within",
	"Blurring out my periphery",
	"My smile is like I won a contest",
	"And to hide that would be so dishonest",
	"And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it",
	"'Til you do, 'til it's true",
	"Now it's like snow at the beach",
	"I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it",
	"I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it",
	"But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet",
	"Now I'm all for you like Janet",
	"Can this be a real thing? Can it?",
	"Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)",
	"Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)",
	"You wanting me (You wanting me)",
	"Like snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)",
	"Like snow on the beach (Flying in a dream)",
	"Like snow on the beach (You wanting me)",
	"(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)",
	"I spy with my little tired eye",
	"Tiny as a firefly",
	"A pebble that we picked up last July",
	"Down deep inside your pocket",
	"We almost forgot it",
	"Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?",
	"Ooh, ooh",
	"They said the end is comin'",
	"Everyone’s up to somethin'",
	"I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings",
	"Outside, they’re push and shovin'",
	"You're in the kitchen hummin'",
	"All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'",
	"On the way home",
	"I wrote a poem",
	"You say, \"What a mind\"",
	"This happens all the time",
	"'Causе they said the end is comin'",
	"Evеryone's up to somethin’",
	"I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings",
	"Outside, they're push and shovin’",
	"All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'",
	"Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors",
	"And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other",
	"And the voices that implore, \"You should be doing more\"",
	"To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it",
	"Ooh",
	"Everyone's up to somethin'",
	"Outside, they're push and shovin'",
	"They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')",
	"Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')",
	"Outside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')",
	"You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')",
	"My knuckles were bruised like violets",
	"Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked",
	"Spineless in my tomb of silence",
	"Tore your banners down, took the battle underground",
	"And maybe it was egos swinging",
	"Maybe it was her",
	"Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur",
	"All that bloodshed, crimson clover",
	"Uh-huh, sweet dream was over",
	"My hand was the one you reached for",
	"All throughout the Great War",
	"Always remember",
	"Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter",
	"I vowed not to cry anymore",
	"If wе survived the Great War",
	"You drew up some good faith treaties",
	"I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone",
	"You said I have to trust more freely",
	"But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire",
	"And maybe it's the past that's talking",
	"Screaming from the crypt",
	"Telling me to punish you for things you never did",
	"So I justified it",
	"Uh-huh, the bombs were closer",
	"Uh-huh, the burning embers",
	"I vowed not to fight anymore",
	"If we survived the Great War",
	"Uh-huh, uh-huh",
	"It turned into something bigger",
	"Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed",
	"Your finger on my hairpin triggers",
	"Soldier down on that icy ground",
	"Looked up at me with honor and truth",
	"Broken and blue, so I called off the troops",
	"That was the night I nearly lost you",
	"I really thought I'd lost you",
	"We can plant a memory garden",
	"Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair",
	"There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair",
	"And we will never go back",
	"To that bloodshed, crimson clover",
	"Uh-huh, the worst was over",
	"Uh-huh, we're burned for better",
	"I vowed I would always be yours",
	"'Cause we survived the Great War",
	"I will always be yours",
	"Uh-huh",
	"I vow I will always be yours",
	"Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man",
	"You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them",
	"Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie",
	"They say looks can kill and I might try",
	"I don't dress for women",
	"I don't dress for men",
	"Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge",
	"I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends",
	"Don't get sad, get even",
	"So on the weekends",
	"I don't dress for friends",
	"She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some",
	"She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?",
	"Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride",
	"Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife",
	"And she looks so pretty",
	"Drivin' in your Benz",
	"Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge",
	"She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends",
	"She don't dress for friends",
	"Lately, she's been dressing for revenge",
	"Ladies always rise above",
	"Ladies know what people want",
	"Someone sweet and kind and fun",
	"The lady simply had enough",
	"While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine",
	"Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI",
	"And I don't dress for villains",
	"Or for innocents",
	"I'm on my vigilante shit again",
	"If you would've blinked, then I would've",
	"Looked away at the first glance",
	"If you tasted poison, you could've",
	"Spit me out at the first chance",
	"And if I was some paint, did it splatter",
	"On a promising grown man?",
	"And if I was a child, did it matter",
	"If you got to wash your hands?",
	"Ooh, all I used to do was pray",
	"Would've, could've, should've",
	"If you'd never looked my way",
	"I would've stayed on my knees",
	"And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil",
	"At nineteen",
	"And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven",
	"And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts",
	"Memories feel like weapons",
	"And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering",
	"If you never touched me, I would've",
	"Gone along with the righteous",
	"If I never blushed, then they could've",
	"Never whispered about this",
	"And if you never saved me from boredom",
	"I could've gone on as I was",
	"But, Lord, you made me feel important",
	"And then you tried to erase us",
	"Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith",
	"If I'd only played it safe",
	"God rest my soul",
	"I miss who I used to be",
	"The tomb won't close",
	"Stained glass windows in my mind",
	"I regret you all the time",
	"I can't let this go",
	"I fight with you in my sleep",
	"The wound won't close",
	"I keep on waiting for a sign",
	"If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?",
	"Years of tearing down our banners, you and I",
	"Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts",
	"Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first",
	"Oh, God rest my soul",
	"Summer went away, still, the yearning stays",
	"I play it cool with the best of them",
	"I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me",
	"It's okay, we're the best of friends",
	"Anyway",
	"I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys",
	"I touch my phone as if it's your face",
	"I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out",
	"There's just one who could make me stay",
	"All my days",
	"From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes",
	"I waited ages to see you there",
	"I search the party of better bodies",
	"Just to learn that you never cared",
	"You're on your own, kid",
	"You always have been",
	"I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May",
	"I picked the petals, he loves me not",
	"Something different bloomed, writing in my room",
	"I play my songs in the parking lot",
	"I'll run away",
	"I called a taxi to take me there",
	"Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare",
	"I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this",
	"I hosted parties and starved my body",
	"Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss",
	"The jokes weren't funny, I took the money",
	"My friends from home don't know what to say",
	"I looked around in a blood-soaked gown",
	"And I saw something they can't take away",
	"'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned",
	"Everything you lose is a step you take",
	"So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it",
	"You've got no reason to be afraid",
	"Yeah, you can face this"
